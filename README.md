# System-Level Computing Projects 

This repository contains three system-level computing projects implemented in C++:  

- **Multi-threaded MapReduce Framework** – A parallel MapReduce implementation using threads for efficient data processing.  
- **User-Level Thread Management Library** – A lightweight thread management library that handles user-space threading.  
- **Virtual Memory Management System** – A hierarchical page table-based virtual memory system with simulated address translation and page replacement.  

Each project explores core system-level computing concepts such as concurrency, memory management, and operating system fundamentals.
